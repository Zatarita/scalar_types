//! This library was created to assist with parsing endian sensitive content.
//! It allows us to parse the data normally as though it was native endianness.
//! Then when we need the value we can cast the value to the desired endianness.
//! 
//! This saves us from having to create conditional parsing using T::from_xx_bytes,
//! and instead allows us to lazily parse the values. then convert them when we need them.
//! this acts kinda like a endian "superposition".
//! 
//! Since this also wraps all the basic scalar types, it gives us a common type
//! to pass to functions that tags the data as endian sensitive. 
//! 
//! Also included are helper functions to make loading values from a stream quicker.
//! 
//! Let's look at a basic use case. We have a file that could of been created on
//! a big or little endian system. The implementation of the file specification
//! states the first byte in the file will signal if the rest of the file is
//! big or little endian. Let's say 0x00 for little endian, and 0x01 for big.
//! 
//! Let's create a program that parses the first byte and stores the endianness
//! of the file. Then using that endianness cast a value read from the file.
//! 
//! ```
//! use scalar_types::Endian;
//! use std::io::{BufReader, Result};
//!  
//! fn read_some_stuff() -> Result<()> {
//!     // Binary file contains 01 | 00 00 00 02 .. ..
//!     //      Big Endian Flag-^    ^-Big Endian 0x2
//!     // System endianness is little endian
//!     let file = std::fs::File::open("file.bin")?;
//!     let mut reader = BufReader::new(file);
//! 
//!     // File endianness changes based on system that made it
//!     // The first byte in the file determines the endianness; 
//!     // 0 = little, 1 = big
//!     let mut buffer = vec![0u8];
//!     reader.read_exact(&mut buffer)?;
//! 
//!     // We can then store the endianness as a variable
//!     // and use this to cast. Allowing us to dynamically
//!     // cast the data based on the content of the file
//!     let endianness = {
//!         if buffer[0] == 0 { 
//!             Endian::Little(()) 
//!         } else { 
//!             Endian::Big(()) 
//!         }
//!     };
//! 
//!     // Try and read the endian sensitive content normally from stream
//!     // Endian values are Endian::Native by default
//!     let endian_value = Endian::<u32>::from_stream(&mut reader);
//!     let parsed_value = match endian_value {
//!         Some(value) => value,
//!         None => panic!("Unable to parse value from stream!")
//!     };
//! 
//!     // Then we convert the value only when we need it.
//!     // Saving us from having to cast u32::from_xx_bytes for every value
//!     let expanded_value = match parsed_value.cast(endianness) {
//!         Some(value) => value,
//!         None => 0u32
//!     };
//! 
//!     assert_eq!(expanded_value, 2);
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! We can also work the other way around! Let's create the file we just parsed
//! by using Endian. We could easily use to_le_bytes and to_be_bytes; 
//! however, doing so would mean we need to alternate between the two depending on
//! the system we're targeting. Instead, we can just store the target endianness and use the 
//! same code. Dynamically switching the endianness with a stored variable instead.
//! This is a lot cleaner. 
//! 
//! Instead of using to_le_bytes or to_be_bytes; we'll
//! call the to_ne_bytes, and let Endian handle the converting.
//! 
//! ```
//! use scalar_types::Endian;
//! use std::io::{Result, Write};
//! use std::fs::File;
//! use std::path::Path;
//! fn write_some_stuff() -> Result<()> {
//!     // Open a file hand for our output
//!     let mut output = File::create(Path::new("file.bin"))?;
//! 
//!     // since we're a little endian system, writing a big endian file
//!     // we will assign this value explicitly.
//!     // let's store this for later to use it to cast
//!     let endianness = Endian::Big(());
//! 
//!     // Note that Endian::Native isn't actually aware of the system endianness,
//!     // it instead acts as an abstract container like a "superposition". 
//!     // If we wanted to get our native endianness "get_native_endianness()"
//!     // is a helper function that will return the correct endianness.
//!     // let endianness = get_native_endianness()?;
//! 
//!     // Moving forward:
//!     // Our spec says we need to write 0x01 for big endian, or 0x00 for little.
//!     if endianness.is_big() {
//!         write!(output, "\x01")?;
//!     } else {
//!         write!(output, "\x00")?;
//!     };
//! 
//!     // Next we're going to create our native endian 0x02 value
//!     let endian_value = Endian::new(2u32);
//! 
//!     // Finally we write the output
//!     if let Some(value) = endian_value.cast(endianness) {
//!         // We've already handled endianness, so we will use the built-in to_ne_bytes function
//!         output.write(&value.to_ne_bytes())?;
//!     }
//! 
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! This was created to assist me with creating modding tools for video games. As some games share the same
//! data, but the endianness changes based off the console it was built for. Working this way allows me to
//! use the same code for all systems, and cast the values to the native endianness dynamically when needed.
//! I figured I would share it on the off chance other people may find it useful.
